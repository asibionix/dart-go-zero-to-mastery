# Dart & Go — Zero to Mastery with Logic Building, Pseudocode & Flowcharts

A complete **Zero to Mastery roadmap** for learning **Dart** and **Go (Golang)** from the ground up —  
with a strong emphasis on **logic building**, **pseudocode**, and **flowchart-based problem solving**.

---

## Objective

“Before writing a single line of code, build the logic in your mind.”

This repository is designed to help learners master:
- Logic development and algorithmic thinking  
- Writing pseudocode to design programs  
- Flowcharting to visualize logic  
- Implementing solutions in both Dart and Go  
- Building clean, efficient, and production-ready code  
- Mastering OOP, data structures, algorithms, and graph-based logic  

Each topic progresses from **concept → logic → visualization → implementation**.

---

## Learning Framework

This repository follows a **daily structured learning system**.  
Each day focuses on a new concept from **Dart** and **Go official documentation**, developed through logic building and practice.

| Step | Focus Area | Description |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Concept Overview | Theoretical understanding of the topic from official docs |
| 2 | Pseudocode | Write logical steps in plain language to outline the solution |
| 3 | Flowchart | Visualize the logic and control flow using diagrams |
| 4 | Dart Implementation | Code the logic in Dart |
| 5 | Go Implementation | Code the same logic in Go |
| 6 | Analysis | Compare outputs, efficiency, and reasoning between both languages |

Every lesson is designed to strengthen your **problem-solving ability** while building fluency in **Dart and Go**.

---

## Daily Lesson Format

Each daily lesson will contain:
- Concept explanation  
- Pseudocode for the problem  
- Flowchart (drawn via Draw.io or Mermaid)  
- Implementations in both Dart and Go  
- Code walkthrough and analysis  

This ensures complete understanding from **theory to implementation** every single day.

---

## Learning Methodology

“Programming is not about syntax — it’s about structured thinking.”

This repository builds the ability to:
- Break complex problems into smaller, logical steps  
- Visualize algorithmic flow before writing code  
- Apply consistent logic across different languages  
- Transition seamlessly from pseudocode → flowchart → code  
- Strengthen analytical and reasoning skills through practice  

All lessons are based directly on **official Dart** and **Go documentation**, ensuring technical accuracy and real-world standards.

## Learning Model

This repository follows a **Professor–Student learning model**, focused on mastery through repetition and logical thinking.

1. Concept Explanation (based on official documentation and examples)  
2. Logic Building (pseudocode and reasoning)  
3. Visualization (flowcharts)  
4. Implementation (Dart and Go)  
5. Documentation (markdown for each topic)  
6. Version Control and GitHub Upload  

This ensures a **professional, reproducible, and portfolio-quality learning experience**.

“Logic is the soul of programming.  
Pseudocode is the language of logic.  
Flowcharts are the art of visualization.  
Dart and Go are the tools that bring your logic to life.”
