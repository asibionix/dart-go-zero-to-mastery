# 🧠 Dart & Go Zero-to-Mastery — Logic Building Journey

Welcome to my **Zero-to-Mastery learning journey** for mastering **Dart** and **Go (Golang)** from scratch!  
This repository is my personal study notebook where I’ll learn, practice, and build logic step by step — guided by the **official Dart and Go documentation**.

## 🎯 Goal

> “Understand the logic first — code is just the expression of thought.”

This repository is focused on:
- Building a strong foundation in **Dart** and **Go** programming
- Developing **logic building** and **problem-solving** skills
- Practicing **pseudocode** and **flowcharts** before writing code
- Writing **clean, readable, and well-structured programs**
- Documenting my **daily progress** publicly
