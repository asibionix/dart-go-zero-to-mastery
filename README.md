# 🧠 Dart & Go — Zero to Mastery with Logic Building, Pseudocode & Flowcharts

A complete **Zero to Mastery roadmap** for learning **Dart** and **Go (Golang)** from the ground up —  
with a strong emphasis on **logic building**, **pseudocode**, and **flowchart-based problem solving**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

> “Before writing a single line of code, build the logic in your mind.”

This repository is designed to help learners master:
- **Logic development** and algorithmic thinking  
- Writing **pseudocode** to design programs  
- **Flowcharting** to visualize logic  
- Implementing solutions in both **Dart** and **Go**  
- Building clean, efficient, and production-ready code  

Each topic progresses from **concept → logic → visualization → implementation**.

## 🧩 Learning Framework

| Phase | Focus Area | Duration | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Logical Thinking & Algorithm Design | Week 1–2 | Develop structured thinking using pseudocode and flowcharts |
| 2 | Dart Foundations | Week 3–5 | Learn syntax, data types, loops, functions, collections |
| 3 | Go Foundations | Week 6–8 | Learn Go syntax, types, functions, structs, packages |
| 4 | Cross-Language Problem Solving | Week 9–12 | Solve logical problems using both Dart & Go |
| 5 | Real-world Projects | Week 13–20 | Build complete projects (Flutter + Go backend) |

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each topic is organized into a dedicated folder containing logic, visualization, and implementations.


---

## 📘 Daily Lesson Format

Each daily lesson follows this professional learning structure:

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Concept Overview** — Theoretical explanation of the topic |
| 2️⃣ | **Pseudocode** — Logical plan of execution |
| 3️⃣ | **Flowchart** — Visual diagram of the logic flow |
| 4️⃣ | **Dart Code** — Implementation using Dart |
| 5️⃣ | **Go Code** — Implementation using Go |
| 6️⃣ | **Analysis** — Output, efficiency, and reasoning |

---

## 🧱 Learning Methodology

> “Programming is not about syntax — it’s about structured thinking.”

This repository builds the ability to:
- Break complex problems into smaller, solvable steps  
- Visualize algorithmic flow  
- Apply consistent logic across different languages  
- Transition seamlessly from **pseudocode → flowchart → real code**

The learning approach aligns with **official Dart** and **Go documentation standards**.
