# 🧠 Dart & Go Zero-to-Mastery — Logic Building, Pseudocode & Flowcharts

Welcome to my **Zero-to-Mastery journey** of learning **Dart** and **Go (Golang)** —  
with a strong focus on **logic building**, **pseudocode**, and **flowchart-based thinking** before writing any code.

---

## 🎯 Goal

> “Think logically. Write clearly. Code precisely.”

This repository is built to help me (and others) **learn how to think like a programmer** — not just memorize syntax.  
Each topic starts with logic design (pseudocode + flowchart), and then we implement the same logic in **Dart** and **Go**.

## 🧩 What This Repository Covers

- 🔹 Logic building & algorithmic thinking  
- 🔹 Pseudocode writing for every problem  
- 🔹 Flowchart design for visual understanding  
- 🔹 Dart implementation (based on logic)  
- 🔹 Go implementation (same logic)  
- 🔹 Daily progress tracking
