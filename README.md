# 🧠 Dart & Go — Zero to Mastery with Logic Building, Pseudocode & Flowcharts

A complete **Zero to Mastery roadmap** for learning **Dart** and **Go (Golang)** from the ground up —  
with a strong emphasis on **logic building**, **pseudocode**, and **flowchart-based problem solving**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

> “Before writing a single line of code, build the logic in your mind.”

This repository is designed to help learners master:
- **Logic development** and algorithmic thinking  
- Writing **pseudocode** to design programs  
- **Flowcharting** to visualize logic  
- Implementing solutions in both **Dart** and **Go**  
- Building clean, efficient, and production-ready code  

Each topic progresses from **concept → logic → visualization → implementation**.
