# Dart & Go — Zero to Mastery with Logic Building, Pseudocode & Flowcharts

A complete **Zero to Mastery roadmap** for learning **Dart** and **Go (Golang)** from the ground up —  
with a strong emphasis on **logic building**, **pseudocode**, and **flowchart-based problem solving**.

---

## Objective

“Before writing a single line of code, build the logic in your mind.”

This repository is designed to help learners master:
- Logic development and algorithmic thinking  
- Writing pseudocode to design programs  
- Flowcharting to visualize logic  
- Implementing solutions in both Dart and Go  
- Building clean, efficient, and production-ready code  
- Mastering OOP, data structures, algorithms, and graph-based logic  

Each topic progresses from **concept → logic → visualization → implementation**.

## Learning Framework

| Phase | Focus Area | Duration | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Logical Thinking & Algorithm Design | Week 1–2 | Develop structured thinking using pseudocode and flowcharts |
| 2 | Dart Foundations | Week 3–5 | Learn syntax, data types, loops, functions, collections |
| 3 | Go Foundations | Week 6–8 | Learn Go syntax, types, functions, structs, packages |
| 4 | Object-Oriented Programming | Week 9–10 | Master OOP concepts in both Dart and Go |
| 5 | Data Structures & Algorithms | Week 11–14 | Implement and analyze core DSA concepts |
| 6 | Advanced Logic & Graphs | Week 15–17 | Learn recursion, graph algorithms, and problem-solving |
| 7 | Real-world Projects | Week 18–22 | Build complete projects (e.g., Flutter + Go backend) |

---

## Daily Lesson Format

Each daily lesson follows this structured learning format:

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Concept Overview — Theoretical explanation of the topic |
| 2 | Pseudocode — Logical plan of execution |
| 3 | Flowchart — Visual diagram of the logic flow |
| 4 | Dart Code — Implementation using Dart |
| 5 | Go Code — Implementation using Go |
| 6 | Analysis — Output, efficiency, and reasoning |

Every day we will focus on **logic building**, **pseudocode creation**, **flowchart design**, and **implementation using Dart & Go**.

## Learning Methodology

“Programming is not about syntax — it’s about structured thinking.”

This repository builds the ability to:
- Break complex problems into smaller, solvable steps  
- Visualize algorithmic flow  
- Apply consistent logic across different languages  
- Transition seamlessly from pseudocode → flowchart → real code  
- Strengthen problem-solving and computational thinking  

The learning approach aligns with **official Dart** and **Go documentation standards**.
